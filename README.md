[Personal Project] - Project: Portfolio Version 3

# Summary

This will be the third version of my website. I been using Version 2 since Summer 2018. It feels like a good time to upgrade since I have learned so much and I want to put it to the test! Some of the new things I want to try include tech that I been using in school and internships. This includes:

-   Next.js
-   Less
-   Firebase
-   Bootstrap (now that I have more experience with it!)
-   Redux
-   Material UI
-   Better Project structure and code organization
-   Reusing CSS classes so that I am writing less css

If you are seeing this page, it means that I still have not fully finished my website. Also, I might be trying out Gastby as well
