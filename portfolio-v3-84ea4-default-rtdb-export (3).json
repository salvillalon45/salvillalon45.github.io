I had the idea of moving the footer by using margin-top, but I felt that this is not correct solution since I felt it was too brute force. I felt that changing the display to flex was the way to go. This article helped me understand how to do it Sticky Footer, Five Ways. Through this project I was exposed to flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis. Some properties I have not used before. After applying this changes, I noticed that footer was not going all the way across the screen it had some extra margin that was preventing it from fully extending. I learned that we can apply html, body { margin: 0; } that will reset the pages default margin and padding for the entire html file."
